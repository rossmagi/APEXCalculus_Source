In the previous section, we explored a specific techique to solve a specific type of differential equation; a separable differential equation.  In this section, we develop and practice a technique to solve a type of differential equation called a \emph{first order linear} differential equation.

Recall than an algebraic equation in one variable is one that can be written $ax + b = 0,$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.  Notice that the variable $x$ appears to the first power.  The equations $\sqrt{x}+1=0$ and $\sin(x)-3x = 0$ are both nonlinear. A linear differential equation is one in which the dependent variable and its derivatives appear only to the first power.  We focus on first order equations, which first (but not higher order) derivatives of the independent variable.

\definition{def:Linear}{First Order Linear Differential Equation}
{A \textbf{first order linear differential equation} is a differential equation that can be written in the form
	\[
	\frac{dy}{dx} + p(x)y = q(x),
	\]
where $p$ and $q$ are arbitrary functions of the independent variable $x$.

{(a)\ Both.  We identify $p(x) = -x$ and $q(x) = 0.$  The separated form of the equation is $\displaystyle \frac{dy}{y} = x\,dx.$\\
(b)\ Neither.  The $e^y$ term makes the equation nonlinear.  Because of the addition, it is not possible to write the equation in separated form.\\
(c)\ First order linear.  We identify $p(x) = -\cos x$ and $q(x) = \sin x.$  The equation cannot be written in separated form.\\
(d)\ Neither.  Notice that dividing by $y$ results in the nonlinear term $\displaystyle \frac{4\ln x}{y}.$ It is not possible to write the equation in separated form.
}\\

Notice that linearity depends on the dependent variable $y$, not the independent variable $x$.  The functions $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ need not be linear as demonstrated in part (c) of example \ref{ex_identify_linear}.  Neither $\cos x$ nor $\sin x$ are linear functions of $x$, but the differential equation is still linear.

We motivate the solution technique by way of an observation and an example.  We first observe that the expression $\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}\big(xy\big)$ can be expanded via the product rule and implicit differentiation to the expression $\displaystyle x \frac{dy}{dx} + y.$ Now we look at an example.  Consider the first order linear differential equation
	\[
		\frac{dy}{dx} + \frac{1}{x}y = \frac{\sin x \cos x}{x}.
	\]
If we multiply both sides of the differential equation by $x$ and use our observation, we see that the differential equation can be written
	\[
		\frac{d}{dx}\big(xy\big) = \sin x \cos x .
	\]
Integrating both sides of the equation with respect to $x$ and using the substitution $u = \sin x$ on the right results in the implicit solution
	\[
		xy = \frac{1}{2}\sin^2 x + C.
	\]
Solving for $y$ yields the explicit solution
	\[
		y = \frac{\sin^2 x}{2x} + \frac{C}{x}.
	\]
	
\mnote{.45}{\textbf{Note:} In the examples in the previous section, we performed operations on the arbitrary constant $C$, but still called the result $C$. The justification is that the result after the operation is \emph{still} an arbitrary contant.  Here, we divide $C$ by $x$, so the result depends explicitly on the independent variable $x$.  Since $C/x$ is \emph{not} contant, we can't just call it $C$.}

As motivated by the problem we just solved, the basic idea behing solving first order linear differential equations is to multiply both sides of the differential equation by a function, called an \emph{integrating factor}, that makes the left hand side of the equation look like an expanded product rule.  We then condense the left hand side into the derivative of a product and integrate both sides. An obvious question is how to find the integrating factor.

Consider the first order linear equation
	\[
		\frac{dy}{dx} + p(x)y = q(x).
	\]
Let's call the integrating factor $\mu(x)$.  We multiply both sides of the differential equation by $\mu(x)$ to get
	\[
		\mu(x) \left ( \frac{dy}{dx} + p(x)y \right ) = \mu(x)q(x).
	\]
Our goal is to choose $\mu(x)$ so that the left hand side of the differential equation looks like the result of a product rule.  The left hand side of the equation is
	\[
		\mu(x) \frac{dy}{dx} + \mu(x)p(x)y,
	\]
and using the product rule and implicit differentiation,
	\[
		\frac{d}{dx} \big ( \mu(x) y \big ) = \frac{d\mu}{dx}y + \mu(x)\frac{dy}{dx}.
	\]
Equating these two gives
	\[
		\frac{d\mu}{dx}y + \mu(x)\frac{dy}{dx} = \mu(x) \frac{dy}{dx} + \mu(x)p(x)y,
	\]
or
	\[
		\frac{d\mu}{dx} = \mu(x)p(x).	
	\]
In order for the integrating factor $\mu(x)$ to perform its job, it must solve the differential equation above.  But that differential equation is separable, so we can solve it.  The separated form is
	\[
		\frac{d\mu}{\mu} = p(x)\,dx.
	\]
Integrating,
	\[
		\ln \mu = \int p(x)\,dx,
	\]
or
	\[
		\mu(x) = e^{\int p(x)\,dx}.
	\]
If $\mu(x)$ is chosen this way, the differential equation can be written in the form
	\[
		\frac{d}{dx} \big( \mu(x)y \big) = \mu(x)q(x).
	\]
Integrating and solving for $y$, the explicit solution is
	\[
		y = \frac{1}{\mu(x)}\int \big( \mu(x)q(x) \big)\,dx.
	\]
	
\mnote{.45}{\textbf{Note:} Following the steps outlined in the previous section, we should technically end up with $\mu(x) = Ce^{\int p(x)\,dx},$ where $C$ is an arbitrary constant.  Because we multiply both sides of the differential equation by $\mu(x)$, the arbitrary constant cancels, and we omit it when finding the integrating factor. }

Though this formula can be used to write down the solution to a first order linear equation, the process is lost by simply memorizing a formula, and will will always follow the steps outlined in key idea \ref{idea:solving_linear} when solving equations of this type.
